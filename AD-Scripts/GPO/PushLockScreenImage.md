### 1. **Prepare the Lock Screen Image**
   - Choose the image you want to use as the lock screen background.
   - Place the image in a network share that is accessible by all users or on a local path if you prefer.

### 2. **Open Group Policy Management Console**
   - On a domain controller, open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**.
   - Right-click on the organizational unit (OU) where you want to apply the policy and select **"Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here..."**.
   - Name the policy something like "Set Lock Screen Background" and click **OK**.

### 3. **Edit the Group Policy**
   - Right-click the newly created GPO and select **Edit**.
   - Navigate to **Computer Configuration** -> **Policies** -> **Administrative Templates** -> **Control Panel** -> **Personalization**.

### 4. **Configure the Lock Screen Background Policy**
   - Double-click on **"Force a specific default lock screen image"**.
   - Set the policy to **Enabled**.
   - In the **Options** section, enter the path to the lock screen image. This can be a UNC path (e.g., `\\Server\Share\Image.jpg`) or a local path (e.g., `C:\Windows\Web\Screen\Image.jpg`).
   - Click **OK** to save the policy.

### 5. **Apply the Policy**
   - Close the Group Policy Management Editor.
   - The policy should now be linked to the OU. It will be applied to all computers within that OU at the next Group Policy update.

### 6. **Force Group Policy Update (Optional)**
   - To apply the policy immediately, you can run `gpupdate /force` on the target computers.

### Notes:
- Ensure the image file has appropriate permissions so that all users/computers can access it.
- If the policy does not seem to apply, check the path to the image and ensure that the file is accessible.

This approach should successfully set a lock screen background for all users targeted by the Group Policy.
