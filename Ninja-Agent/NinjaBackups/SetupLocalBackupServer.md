To set up an SMB network share on Ubuntu 22.04 for NinjaRMM backups in a Windows Active Directory (AD) environment, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Samba
Samba is the service that allows Ubuntu to act as an SMB server.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba -y
```

### Step 2: Configure Samba
1. Create a directory that will be shared via SMB. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/ninja-backups
   sudo chmod 2770 /srv/samba/ninja-backups
   ```

2. Set ownership of the shared directory. Assuming you will create an AD user later:
   ```bash
   sudo chown root:users /srv/samba/ninja-backups
   ```

3. Open the Samba configuration file for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
   ```

4. Add the following at the end of the file to define your share:
   ```ini
   [NinjaBackups]
   path = /srv/samba/ninja-backups
   browseable = yes
   writable = yes
   create mask = 0770
   directory mask = 0770
   valid users = @users
   ```

### Step 3: Join the Server to Active Directory
1. Install necessary packages for AD integration:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install realmd sssd adcli krb5-user samba-common-bin -y
   ```

2. Discover your AD domain:
   ```bash
   sudo realm discover yourdomain.local
   ```

3. Join the domain:
   ```bash
   sudo realm join --user=administrator yourdomain.local
   ```

4. Check if the server is joined:
   ```bash
   realm list
   ```

5. Enable AD users to access the SMB share. Edit `/etc/samba/smb.conf` again and add:
   ```ini
   security = ads
   realm = YOURDOMAIN.LOCAL
   workgroup = YOURDOMAIN
   ```
   Make sure to configure the correct workgroup and realm.

### Step 4: Restart Samba and Enable Services
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd
sudo systemctl enable smbd nmbd
```

### Step 5: Set Permissions for AD Users
You can assign permissions to the AD users or groups on the shared directory:
```bash
sudo chown :YOURDOMAIN\domain_users /srv/samba/ninja-backups
sudo chmod 2770 /srv/samba/ninja-backups
```

### Step 6: Allow Samba Through the Firewall
If the firewall is enabled, allow SMB traffic:
```bash
sudo ufw allow samba
sudo ufw reload
```

### Step 7: Testing the SMB Share
From a Windows machine:
1. Open File Explorer and enter the Ubuntu serverâ€™s IP address:
   ```
   \\<Ubuntu_Server_IP>\NinjaBackups
   ```

2. Use your AD credentials to authenticate.

After these steps, your Ubuntu 22.04 server will be ready to accept backups via SMB in the NinjaRMM environment.
