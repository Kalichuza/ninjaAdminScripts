# ninjaAdminScripts

This repository is a collection of administrative scripts and tools for managing various aspects of IT infrastructure. These scripts are intended to assist system administrators with tasks such as Active Directory management, network configuration, software deployment, and more. Not all scripts are written by me; some have been aggregated from various sources to provide a comprehensive toolkit for system administrators.
