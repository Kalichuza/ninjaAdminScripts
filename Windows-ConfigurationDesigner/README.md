# Windows Configuration Designer - Adding Custom MSI to a Provisioning Package

This guide walks you through the process of using the Windows Configuration Designer (WCD) in advanced mode to add a custom MSI file to a provisioning package and export it as a `.ppkg` file. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Windows Configuration Designer** installed. You can download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4TX22).
- The **MSI file** you want to include in the provisioning package.
- A **Windows 10/11** machine to create the provisioning package.

## Step 1: Launch Windows Configuration Designer

1. Open the **Windows Configuration Designer** application.
2. In the "Start a new project" screen, select **Advanced provisioning**.

## Step 2: Create a New Project

1. Enter a project name and a project folder location. Choose a location that you can easily access later.
2. Click **Next** to proceed.

## Step 3: Configure Device Settings

1. On the "Choose what to configure" screen, you can select the settings you want to configure. For this guide, we'll focus on adding an MSI file.
2. Click **Finish** after selecting the desired settings.

## Step 4: Add Custom MSI to the Provisioning Package

1. In the left-hand pane, expand the **Runtime settings** section.
2. Expand **ProvisioningCommands** and click on **Primary Context** (or **FirstLogonCommands** depending on when you want the MSI to be installed.)
3. Click on **Add** to add a new provisioning command.
4. The top pane will ask you to select your installer file in the file explorer.
5. Set the **CommandLine** to the MSI installation command for your installer. For example we will use our ninjaOne installer:
    ```plaintext
    msiexec.exe /i "NINJA-INSTALLER.msi" 
    ```
6. You will set the 'ContinueInstall' setting to True and the 'RestartRequired' False
7. Repeat this process for each of the MSI files that you want to install. 

   - Ensure that the install command for each MSI file is correct. Usually, some diligent Googling will provide the correct command for silent install. 

## Step 5: Customize Additional Settings (Optional)

1. You can customize additional settings under **Runtime settings** as needed. This might include configuring Wi-Fi, setting up the device's name, etc.
2. Once you've made all your desired configurations, proceed to the next step.

## Step 6: Export the Provisioning Package

1. In the top menu, click on **Export** and select **Provisioning package**.
2. In the "Build the package" screen, configure the following:
   - **Package Name**: Set a name for the provisioning package.
   - **Owner**: Set to **IT Admin** if the package is being deployed in an enterprise environment.
   - **Rank**: Leave it at the default value unless you have specific deployment requirements.
3. Click **Next**.

## Step 7: Build and Save the Provisioning Package

1. Choose a location to save the `.ppkg` file.
2. Click **Build** to create the provisioning package.
3. Once the build is complete, youâ€™ll find the `.ppkg` file in the location you specified.

## Step 8: Apply the Provisioning Package

1. Copy the `.ppkg` file to the target Windows device.
2. Apply the provisioning package by double-clicking the `.ppkg` file and following the on-screen instructions, or use the `Provisioning Package` tool in Settings -> Accounts -> Access work or school -> Add or remove a provisioning package.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully created and exported a provisioning package with a custom MSI included. This `.ppkg` file can be used to quickly configure multiple devices with the desired settings and software installations.
